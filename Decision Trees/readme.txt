The code contains implementation for decision trees and hyper-parameter calculation using cross validation.
Code has depencies on Java version 1.0.8_101.

This directory contains -
1. Directory DecisionTrees that contains Java source code.
2. Shell script 'decisionTrees.sh' used to run the program. 
3. Directories SettingA, SettingB and SettingC that contain test data sets.
4. Directory TraceFiles that contains sample outputs generated by running decisionTrees.sh.
5. File mushroom.names that contains list of possible features and their values.

To execute the program, 
1. execute the decisionTrees.sh script. 
./decisionTrees.sh
2. Run by giving the the parameters in the following order:
a. Feature file.
b. Training data file.
c. Test data file.
d. Directory that stores split data for cross validation.
e. Hyper parameters(depths) to be tested separated by spaces. Give -1 if data consists of missing values and best substitution method is to be found.
